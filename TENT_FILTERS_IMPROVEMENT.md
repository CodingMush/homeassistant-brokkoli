# Tent Configuration Flow - Sensor Filter Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the Tent configuration flow in the Home Assistant Brokkoli integration to apply specific filters for displaying only appropriate entities when selecting sensors.

## Problem

The previous implementation of the Tent configuration flow was showing all sensor entities without proper filtering, which made it difficult for users to find the appropriate sensors for their tent setup. This resulted in a poor user experience with too many irrelevant options.

## Solution

Implemented specific filters for each sensor type in the Tent configuration flow based on:
1. Device classes
2. Units of measurement

## Implementation Details

### Sensor Filters Applied

1. **Temperature Sensors**:
   - Device class: "temperature"
   - Units of measurement: "°C", "°F", "K"

2. **Humidity Sensors**:
   - Device class: "humidity"
   - Units of measurement: "%"

3. **CO2 Sensors**:
   - Device class: "carbon_dioxide"
   - Units of measurement: "ppm"

4. **Illuminance Sensors**:
   - Device class: "illuminance"
   - Units of measurement: "lx", "lux"

5. **Power Consumption Sensors**:
   - Device class: "power"
   - Units of measurement: "W", "kW"

### Code Changes

Modified the `async_step_tent` method in `config_flow.py` to include specific filters for each sensor selector:

```python
vol.Optional(FLOW_SENSOR_TEMPERATURE): selector({
    "entity": {
        "filter": [
            {"domain": "sensor", "device_class": "temperature"},
            {"domain": "sensor", "unit_of_measurement": "°C"},
            {"domain": "sensor", "unit_of_measurement": "°F"},
            {"domain": "sensor", "unit_of_measurement": "K"}
        ]
    }
}),
# Similar filters for other sensor types...
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users now see only relevant sensors for each sensor type
2. **Reduced Configuration Errors**: Filtering prevents selection of inappropriate sensors
3. **Faster Configuration**: Users can quickly find the sensors they need
4. **Better Integration**: Aligns with Home Assistant's best practices for entity selection

## Testing

Created and ran a test script to verify:
- ✅ Module imports successfully
- ✅ Filter structure is properly defined
- ✅ All sensor selectors have appropriate filters

## Files Modified

1. `custom_components/plant/config_flow.py` - Added specific filters to sensor selectors
2. `test_tent_filters.py` - Created test script to verify the implementation

## Verification

All tests pass successfully, confirming that:
- The configuration flow module imports without errors
- The filter structure is correctly implemented
- Each sensor selector has appropriate device class and unit of measurement filters

The Tent configuration flow now provides a much better user experience by showing only relevant sensors for each sensor type selection.
