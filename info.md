# Brokkoli Plant Management for Home Assistant

> **Note**
> 
> This project is based on the work of [@Olen](https://github.com/Olen) and his "Alternative plants component" integration.

> All credit for the original development goes to the original author.

This integration can automatically fetch data from [Seedfinder](https://github.com/dingausmwald/homeassistant-seedfinder) if you are a registered user. Registration is free.

# BREAKING CHANGES

>**Warning**
>
> **This integration is *not* compatible with the original plant integration in HA.**

Plants are set up in the UI and all configuration of your plants can be managed there or by automations and scripts.

This Brokkoli integration is available as a beta release in HACS through this repository.
