# Tent Sensor Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of Tent sensor management in the Home Assistant Brokkoli integration, including how sensors are updated through services and inherited by Plants.

## Key Components

### 1. Services Implementation
The following services have been implemented to manage Tent sensors:

- **`create_tent`**: Creates a new Tent entity
- **`update_tent_sensors`**: Updates the sensors associated with a Tent
- **`change_tent`**: Changes a Plant's Tent assignment and updates its sensors

### 2. Tent Class
The [Tent](file:///D:/Python/2/homeassistant-brokkoli/custom_components/plant/tent.py#L76-L258) class manages sensor associations:
- Stores sensor entity IDs in a list
- Provides methods to add/remove sensors
- Automatically persists sensor data to config entries
- Includes [assign_to_plant](file:///D:/Python/2/homeassistant-brokkoli/custom_components/plant/tent.py#L183-L185) method for sensor inheritance

### 3. PlantDevice Class
The [PlantDevice](file:///D:/Python/2/homeassistant-brokkoli/custom_components/plant/__init__.py#L316-L2277) class includes the [replace_sensors](file:///D:/Python/2/homeassistant-brokkoli/custom_components/plant/__init__.py#L352-L415) method that:
- Maps Tent sensors to Plant sensor types based on device class or unit of measurement
- Automatically assigns appropriate sensors to Plants
- Updates config entries to persist assignments

## Complete Flow

1. **Create Tent**: User creates a Tent via the `create_tent` service
2. **Update Sensors**: User updates Tent sensors via the `update_tent_sensors` service
3. **Assign Plant**: User assigns a Plant to a Tent via the `change_tent` service
4. **Sensor Mapping**: Tent automatically maps its sensors to Plant sensor types
5. **Sensor Assignment**: Plant sensors are updated with corresponding Tent sensor entity IDs
6. **Persistence**: Config entries are updated to persist all sensor assignments

## Automatic Sensor Mapping Logic

The system automatically maps Tent sensors to Plant sensors based on:

| Plant Sensor Type | Matching Criteria |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Temperature | `device_class="temperature"` OR `unit_of_measurement` in `["°C", "°F", "K"]` |
| Humidity | `device_class="humidity"` OR `unit_of_measurement="%"` (air humidity) |
| Soil Moisture | `unit_of_measurement="%"` AND `"soil"` or `"moisture"` in entity name |
| Illuminance | `device_class="illuminance"` OR `unit_of_measurement` in `["lx", "lux"]` |
| Conductivity | `device_class="conductivity"` OR `unit_of_measurement="µS/cm"` |
| CO2 | `"co2"` in entity name OR `unit_of_measurement="ppm"` |
| Power Consumption | `"power"` in entity name OR `unit_of_measurement` in `["W", "kW"]` |
| pH | `"ph"` in entity name OR `unit_of_measurement` in `["pH", "ph"]` |

## Verification Results

✅ All services are properly implemented and registered
✅ Tent class has complete sensor management functionality
✅ PlantDevice class has automatic sensor mapping capability
✅ Services are properly defined in services.yaml
✅ Module imports successfully without errors
✅ Sensor inheritance works automatically when assigning Plants to Tents

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Setup**: Users can easily assign Plants to Tents with automatic sensor mapping
2. **Reduced Configuration Errors**: Automatic sensor type detection prevents incorrect assignments
3. **Persistent Storage**: Sensor assignments are saved in config entries
4. **Flexible Management**: Sensors can be updated for Tents at any time
5. **Scalable**: Multiple Plants can inherit sensors from the same Tent

The implementation successfully addresses the original requirement to make assigning Plants to new Tents easier by asking for the same sensor names as used for Plants, and ensures that Tent sensors are successfully updated through services.
