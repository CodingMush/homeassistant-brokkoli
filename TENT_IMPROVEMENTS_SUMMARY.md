# Tent Entity Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the Tent entity in the Home Assistant Brokkoli integration to enhance visibility of assigned sensors, maintenance records, and journal entries.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Added State Property
- Added a `state` property that returns `STATE_OK` to indicate the tent is functioning properly
- This allows the tent entity to have a visible state in Home Assistant

### 2. Enhanced Extra State Attributes
Added comprehensive `extra_state_attributes` to expose detailed information about the tent:

#### Sensor Information
- `sensors`: List of all sensor entity IDs assigned to the tent
- `sensor_details`: Detailed information about each sensor including:
  - Entity ID
  - Current state value
  - Unit of measurement
  - Device class
- `sensor_count`: Total number of sensors assigned to the tent

#### Maintenance Records
- `maintenance_entries`: List of all maintenance entries with details:
  - Timestamp
  - Description
  - Performed by
  - Cost
- `maintenance_count`: Total number of maintenance entries

#### Journal Entries
- `journal_entries`: List of all journal entries with details:
  - Timestamp
  - Content
  - Author
- `journal_entry_count`: Total number of journal entries

#### Additional Information
- `tent_id`: The unique identifier for the tent
- `created_at`: When the tent was created
- `updated_at`: When the tent was last updated

### 3. Improved Data Formatting
- Sensor details now include live state information from Home Assistant
- Maintenance and journal entries are formatted for better readability
- Added count properties for quick overview of tent contents

## Benefits
These improvements provide better visibility into tent configurations directly in Home Assistant:

1. **Sensor Visibility**: Users can see all sensors assigned to a tent and their current values
2. **Maintenance Tracking**: Maintenance history is visible as entity attributes
3. **Journal Documentation**: Journal entries are accessible through entity attributes
4. **Quick Overview**: Count properties provide at-a-glance information about tent contents

## Testing
A comprehensive test script was created and executed successfully to verify:
- State property returns correct value
- Extra state attributes contain all expected information
- Sensor details include live state data
- Maintenance and journal entries are properly formatted
- Adding new entries updates the counts correctly

## Files Modified
- `custom_components/plant/tent.py`: Enhanced Tent entity with state and extra_state_attributes properties
- `test_tent_improvements.py`: Test script to verify the improvements work correctly
