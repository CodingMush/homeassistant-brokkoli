# Brokkoli Cannabis Management for Home Assistant

**The foundation of the Brokkoli Suite - Cannabis monitoring integration for Home Assistant**

A Home Assistant integration for monitoring cannabis plants with sensors and configurable thresholds. Part of the Brokkoli Suite for cannabis cultivation tracking.

## üå± Features

### Device-based Plant Management
- Cannabis plants as Home Assistant devices with grouped sensor entities
- Configurable thresholds for each sensor type
- Problem state when sensor values exceed limits
- Individual plant helpers: health status, growing phase, flowering duration
- Cycle system for grouping plants together

### Supported Sensors
- **Moisture**: Soil moisture percentage
- **Temperature**: Ambient temperature (¬∞C/¬∞F)
- **Light/Brightness**: Light intensity (lux)
- **Conductivity**: Soil conductivity (¬µS/cm)
- **pH**: Soil pH level
- **Humidity**: Air humidity percentage
- **Co2**: Air CO2 ppm
- **Power**: Power consumption monitoring
- **Daily Light Integral (DLI)**: Calculated from light sensors

### Seedfinder Integration
- Strain data fetching during setup
- Strain images and basic information
- Growth phase definitions

### Services & Configuration
- UI-based setup through config flow
- Various services to interact with plants
- Sensor changes directly in plant configuration
- Automation triggers for dynamic sensor switching (e.g., room changes)

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
For the complete Brokkoli Suite, install these complementary components:

- **[Brokkoli Card](https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card)** - Lovelace cards for cannabis visualization
- **[Seedfinder Integration](https://github.com/dingausmwald/homeassistant-seedfinder)** - Cannabis strain data and information

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

1. Add this repository as a [Custom Repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) in HACS
2. Set the category to "Integration"
3. Click "Install" on the "Brokkoli Cannabis Management" card
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/plant/` directory to your `<config>/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set up your first cannabis plant
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Add Integration**
2. Search for "Plant" and select it
3. Follow the configuration flow to set up your cannabis plant
4. Assign your sensors (moisture, temperature, light, etc.)

### 2. Configure thresholds
- Each threshold (min/max values) becomes its own entity
- Adjust thresholds directly from the UI or via automations
- Changes take effect immediately without restart

### 3. Monitor and maintain
- View all cannabis plants under **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Devices**
- Check plant status and sensor readings
- Monitor problem states when sensor values exceed thresholds

## üìä Sensor management

Sensors can be changed directly in the plant configuration or dynamically via automations (e.g., when moving rooms).

## üé® Brokkoli Suite

Brokkoli Cannabis Management is the foundation of the Brokkoli Suite:

### [Brokkoli Card](https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card)
- Individual plant cards
- Area cards for spatial arrangement
- List views
- Interactive positioning

### [Seedfinder Integration](https://github.com/dingausmwald/homeassistant-seedfinder)
- Access to strain database
- Data fetching during setup
- Imagery and basic information
- Growth phase definitions

## üîß Configuration

### Problem detection
Choose which sensor violations should trigger problem states:

1. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Plant Monitor**
2. Select your plant device
3. Click **Configure**
4. Choose which threshold violations should trigger alerts

### Strain management
Update strain and refresh data from Seedfinder:

1. Go to cannabis plant device configuration
2. Enter the exact strain name (Seedfinder PID format)
3. Enable "Force refresh" to update all data including images
4. Strain changes take effect immediately

## üì± Available services

The integration provides the following services:

- `plant.replace_sensor` - Replace sensors for a plant
- `plant.create_plant` - Create a new plant
- `plant.remove_plant` - Remove a plant and all its entities
- `plant.clone_plant` - Create a clone/cutting of an existing plant
- `plant.create_cycle` - Create a new cycle for grouping plants
- `plant.remove_cycle` - Remove a cycle and all its entities
- `plant.move_to_cycle` - Move plants to a cycle or remove from cycle
- `plant.update_plant_attributes` - Update plant attributes and information
- `plant.move_to_area` - Move plants to different areas
- `plant.add_image` - Add images to plants
- `plant.change_position` - Change plant position coordinates
- `plant.export_plants` - Export plant configurations
- `plant.import_plants` - Import plant configurations

These services are integrated into the [Brokkoli Card](https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card) and can also be used directly in automations/scripts.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Sensor values not updating
If old values persist after reconfiguration:
- Use `replace_sensor` service instead of removing/adding plants

### Strain not found
- Ensure exact Seedfinder PID format
- Verify Seedfinder integration is configured
