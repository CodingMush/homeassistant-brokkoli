# Tent Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

The tent integration feature branch had several issues related to virtual sensors:

1. **Incomplete Tent Implementation**: The tent implementation was incomplete and didn't properly integrate with the existing plant architecture
2. **Virtual Sensor Issues**: Virtual sensors were not properly registered as entities in Home Assistant, making them inaccessible to the Lovelace card
3. **Architecture Problems**: The tent implementation created a separate device type rather than integrating with the existing plant/cycle architecture

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Detailed architecture documentation for the integration
- `TENT_INTEGRATION.md`: Design document for tent integration

### 2. Added Tests

Created comprehensive test suite:
- `test_plant_device.py`: Tests for PlantDevice functionality
- `test_virtual_sensors.py`: Tests for virtual sensors
- `test_tent.py`: Tests for tent functionality
- `test_tent_integration_fixes.py`: Tests for the tent integration fixes

### 3. Tent Integration Implementation

Created a proper tent integration that works with the existing plant system:

#### Key Components

1. **TentIntegration Class**: Manages tent information and plant assignments
2. **TentInfo Class**: Stores information about individual tents
3. **Plant Extensions**: Added tent attributes to PlantDevice class

#### Key Features

1. **Sensor Sharing**: Plants can use tent sensors when no external sensor is assigned
2. **Plant-Tent Relationship**: Plants can be assigned to tents for environmental monitoring
3. **Virtual Sensor Support**: Virtual sensors work properly with tent integration

### 4. Code Changes

#### Modified Files

1. `custom_components/plant/__init__.py`:
   - Added tent attributes to PlantDevice
   - Extended websocket_info to include tent data

2. `custom_components/plant/sensor.py`:
   - Added get_effective_sensor method to PlantCurrentStatus
   - Modified async_update to use effective sensor
   - Modified state_changed to use effective sensor

3. `custom_components/plant/plant_meters.py`:
   - Added get_effective_sensor method to PlantCurrentStatus
   - Modified async_update to use effective sensor
   - Modified state_changed to use effective sensor

#### New Files

1. `custom_components/plant/tent_integration.py`: Core tent integration functionality
2. `custom_components/plant/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Architecture documentation
3. `custom_components/plant/TENT_INTEGRATION.md`: Tent integration design document
4. `tests/test_plant_device.py`: Tests for PlantDevice
5. `tests/test_virtual_sensors.py`: Tests for virtual sensors
6. `tests/test_tent.py`: Tests for tent functionality
7. `tests/test_tent_integration_fixes.py`: Tests for tent integration fixes
8. `tests/conftest.py`: Test fixtures

## How It Works

### Plant-Tent Relationship

Plants can be assigned to tents, allowing them to share environmental sensors:

```python
# Assign a plant to a tent
tent_integration.assign_plant_to_tent("plant.my_plant", "tent_1")

# Get tent sensors for the plant
tent_sensors = tent_integration.get_tent_sensors("tent_1")
```

### Sensor Selection

The system uses a hierarchy to determine which sensor to use:

1. **External Sensor**: If explicitly assigned, use it
2. **Tent Sensor**: If plant is in a tent and no external sensor, use tent sensor
3. **None**: If neither available, sensor shows as unavailable

### Virtual Sensors

Virtual sensors (DLI, PPFD, consumption) work properly with tent integration because:

1. They inherit the effective sensor logic from base sensors
2. They are properly registered as Home Assistant entities
3. They are included in the WebSocket API response

## Benefits

1. **Proper Integration**: Tents work within the existing plant architecture
2. **Sensor Sharing**: Multiple plants can share tent sensors
3. **Virtual Sensor Support**: All virtual sensors work correctly
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing plant functionality is preserved
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new tent features

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Plant device initialization and functionality
- Virtual sensor creation and calculation
- Tent integration functionality
- Sensor selection logic
- WebSocket API responses
