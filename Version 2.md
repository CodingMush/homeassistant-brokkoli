# News in version 2.0.0

## Plants are now treated as _devices_

This means that the main plant entity references other entities, and they are grouped togheter in the GUI as a single device.

This also means that this version is _not_ compatible with earlier releases from this repository, or with the "plant" integration that is part of your default Home Assistant installation 

## Highlights 

### Use the UI to set up plant devices
* Config Flow is used to set up the plants

* This works both with and without OpenPlantbook

### Better handling of thresholds

* All thresholds and plant images are fetched automatically from OpenPlantbook if available
* All thresholds now are their own entities and their values can be changed from the UI or by scripts and automations.
* These changes are instantly reflected in HA. No need to restart to change the thresholds.

* Max and min temperature is now dependent on the unit of measurement - currently 째C and 째F is supported.
  * The values will be updated if you change your units in the Home Assistant settings

### Easier to replace sensors

* You can use a service call to replace the different sensors used to monitor the plant

* The new sensor values are immediately picked up by the plant integration without any need to restart

### Better handling of species and image

* If you change the species of a plant in the UI, new data are fetched from OpenPlantbook
* Image can also be updated from the UI
* These updates are immediately reflected in HA without restarting anything.

* Illuminance warnings are now triggered by calculating the "Daily Light Integral" - DLI.
* You can chose to disable warnings on high/low temperature, humidity and illuminance/DLI.


### Daily Light Integral

* A new Daily Light Integral - DLI - sensor is created for all plants.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_light_integral for what DLI means

### More flexible lovelace card

* I have upgraded the Lovelace flower card to make use of the new integration, and made it more flexible.

* The flower card also handles both 째C and 째F
