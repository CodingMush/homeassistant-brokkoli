# Home Assistant Plant Component Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unit Inconsistency for Conductivity Sensors
- **Problem**: Long-term statistics generation was suppressed because the unit "µS/cm" (micro sign) couldn't be converted to the previously compiled statistics unit "μS/cm" (Greek mu)
- **Root Cause**: The system was using micro sign (µ, code 181) instead of Greek mu (μ, code 956) for conductivity units
- **Fix**: Changed `UNIT_CONDUCTIVITY` constant in `const.py` from "µS/cm" to "μS/cm"
- **Result**: Long-term statistics generation should now work properly for conductivity sensors

### 2. AttributeError in Sensor Updates
- **Problem**: AttributeError indicating that a 'super' object has no attribute 'async_update' in sensor.async_update methods
- **Root Cause**: Some sensor classes were trying to call `super().async_update()` but their parent class [PlantCurrentStatus](file:///d:/Python/git/homeassistant-brokkoli/custom_components/plant/sensor.py#L385-L521) doesn't have an [async_update](file:///d:/Python/git/homeassistant-brokkoli/custom_components/plant/sensor.py#L346-L347) method
- **Fix**: Removed the call to `super().async_update()` and added a comment explaining why
- **Result**: Sensors should now update properly without throwing AttributeError

## Files Modified
- `custom_components/plant/const.py` - Changed conductivity unit from micro sign to Greek mu
- `custom_components/plant/sensor.py` - Fixed sensor.async_update methods to not call non-existent parent method

## Verification
- All syntax errors resolved - component compiles successfully
- Unit consistency fixed - conductivity sensors now use Greek mu (μ) to match previous statistics
- Sensor updates fixed - no more AttributeError when updating sensors

## Expected Outcome
- Long-term statistics generation for conductivity sensors should resume working
- Virtual sensors should update without throwing AttributeError
- All existing functionality should remain intact
